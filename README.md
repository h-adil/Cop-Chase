# Cop-Chase
A Python based Pathfinding algorithm that simulates a cop chase. Uses dynamic aspects to enhance complexity. The user is asked to input a starting position (Anywhere on the city map) to emulate freedom to the user. This program was designed using advanced skills such as object-oriented programming, recursion, and Algorithm design. (Front-end design coming!)
